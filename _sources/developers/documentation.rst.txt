How to document Dotmanager
==========================

The documentation and man page of Dotmanager are generated with Sphinx_. It consists of
mainly two big parts. First the reference manual, which is generated from the
source code, and second the user guides which are generated from the sphinx
source directory.

You will find most information on how to write documentation with Sphinx in
their own documentation. This document covers only how Sphinx is set up in this
project as well as building instructions.


Structure / Set up
==================

- Sphinx is located at ``docs/sphinx/``.
- All user guides are located at ``docs/sphinx/source/usage/``
- All developer guides (except for CONTRIBUTING.rst) are located at
  ``docs/sphinx/source/developers/``
- The theme was modified to hide or highlight some information in the reference
  manual with ``docs/sphinx/source/custom.css``
- Sphinx uses the autodoc, napoleon and github pages plugin
- The built html documentation can be found in ``docs/sphinx/build/html/``
- The built man page can be found in ``docs/sphinx/build/man/``
- The man page is built from a subset of user guides


Generating documentation
========================

To generate the documentation locally on your device you will need to install Sphinx
and the autodoc plugin. To do so, you can use pip:

.. code: bash

    pip install sphinx autodoc

Then you can build the documentation with:

.. code: bash

    cd docs/sphinx
    make html

And open it directly in your favorite web browser:

.. code: bash

    firefox build/html/index.html

The same goes for the man page:

.. code: bash

    cd docs/sphinx
    make man

    man -l build/man/dotmanager.1

If you delete or rename file you might want to do a clean up of the build directory:

.. code: bash

    cd docs/sphinx

    make clean-html  # Clean only the html build
    make clean-man  # Clean only the man page build

    make clean  # Clean all builds


Deploying
=========

The documentation and man page will be automatically generated when you create a pull
request to verify it builds without errors. When your pull request is merged
into master, Travis will deploy ``docs/sphinx/build/html/`` to the gh-pages branch,
which is used to host the documentation.
If there are changes to the man page, Travis will commit and push them to the master.

Note: While the man page build is tracked/checked into git, the html documentation is
not checked in and only available at the gh-pages branch.
