Commandline Interface
*********************

This document explains all commandline options in detail.

The general syntax is:

::

 dotmgr.py [--directory DIRECTORY] [-d] [--dui] [-f] [-m] [--option KEY=VAL [KEY=VAL ...]] [--parent PARENT]
           [-p] [--save SAVE] [--superforce] [-v] (-h | -i | -u | -s | --version) [profiles [profiles ...]]

There are 5 modes of which you have to specify exactly one:

+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Mode       | Description                                             |
+============+=========================================================+
| -h, –help  | Shows a short help message with all options and modes   |
|            | and exits                                               |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| –version   | Shows the version of dotmanager and exits               |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| -i,        | Installs every specified profile. If a profile is       |
| –install   | already installed it will be updated instead of         |
|            | installed.                                              |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| -u,        | Uninstalls every specified profile. If a profile is not |
| –uninstall | installed, dotmanager will skip this profile.           |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| -s, –show  | Shows information about installed profiles and links.   |
|            | If you specify ``profiles`` this will show only         |
|            | information about those profiles. Otherwise information |
|            | about all installed profiles will be shown.             |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+

You can also choose a couple of optional arguments:

+------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| Option           | Description                                       |
+==================+===================================================+
| –directory       | Overwrites the default directory temporarily      |
| DIRECTORY        |                                                   |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| -d, –dry-run     | Simulates the changes dotmanager would perform if |
|                  | executed without this flag                        |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| –dui             | Use an alternative startegy to install profiles   |
|                  | and links. The default strategy will do this by   |
|                  | recursively go through the profiles and           |
|                  | create/update all links one by one. This can      |
|                  | cause conflicts if e.g. a link is moved from one  |
|                  | to another profile. This strategy installs links  |
|                  | by first doing all removals, then all updates and |
|                  | last all new installs. Most conflicts should be   |
|                  | solved by this strategy but it has the downside   |
|                  | that the output isn’t that clear as the normal    |
|                  | strategy.                                         |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| -f, –force       | Overwrites files that already exists in your      |
|                  | filesystem with your links                        |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| –log LOGFILE     | Log everything in a logfile (this also adds       |
|                  | timestamps to the log messages)                   |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| -m, –makedirs    | Makes directories if they don’t exist. Any        |
|                  | directory created inherits the owner of its       |
|                  | parent directory.                                 |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| –option KEY=VAL  | Let you temporarily overwrite the option section  |
| [KEY=VAL …]      | of your config file                               |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| –parent PARENT   | Forces the profiles that you install/update to be |
|                  | installed as subprofile of PARENT. This should be |
|                  | only needed to solve certain conflicts.           |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| –plain           | Prints the ``DiffLog`` unformatted and exits.     |
|                  | Only used for debugging purpose.                  |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| -p,              | Prints out the changes that dotmanager would      |
| –pretty-print    | perform if executed without this flag. This       |
|                  | differs from ``--dry-run`` in that way that it    |
|                  | won’t do any checks on the profiles or            |
|                  | filesystem, so ``--dry-run`` is almost always to  |
|                  | prefer. The only use-case is if your profiles     |
|                  | will raise an error and aborts but you want to    |
|                  | now what would have happen to get a better        |
|                  | understanding of the issue in your                |
|                  | profile/workflow itself.                          |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| -q, –quiet       | Print no log messages but warnings and errors     |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| –save SAVE       | Use another ``installed-file`` for this           |
|                  | execution. Can be used to install profiles        |
|                  | multiple times on the same device. But be         |
|                  | carefully not fuck up your other installations of |
|                  | those profiles! This is mostly useful if you want |
|                  | to test the linking process in another directory  |
|                  | or if those profiles are installed in completely  |
|                  | different locations of your device                |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| –silent          | Print no log messages at all                      |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| –superforce      | Overwrites files and links that are blacklisted   |
|                  | because it is considered dangerous to overwrite   |
|                  | those files e.g. \ ``/etc/hosts`` or              |
|                  | ``/etc/passwd``                                   |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| -v, –verbose     | Shows more information of the linking process and |
|                  | a stacktrace when error occur                     |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------------+

``profiles`` is a space seperated list of profiles. Any profile will be
identified by its class name, not by its filename. Don’t forget that
python class names are case-sensitive.
