Getting started
===============


---------------------------------------------------------
Step 0: Put your dotfiles into version control (optional)
---------------------------------------------------------
I highly recommend to put all your dotfiles and the profiles that you are going
to write into a version control system like git or svn for obvious reasons. But
this is not required. The only requirement is that you have one directory that
contains all your dotfiles. Subdirectories are ok, just make sure that your
dotfiles are named uniquely.


--------------------
Step 1: Installation
--------------------
In near future there will be packages for AUR and pip available, as well as a
portable binary. But for now you will have to set up Dotmanager by yourself.

Step 1a: Manual set up
======================
First clone the repository:

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/RickestRickSanchez/dotmanager.git

Then install dependencies:

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get install python3
    # if you want to use encryption features
    sudo apt-get install python3 gnupg

You can run

.. code:: bash

    dotmanager/test/regressiontest.py

to verify that Dotmanager runs correctly on your system.


---------------------
Step 3: Configuration
---------------------
There are a lot of things that you can configure in Dotmanager but for most of
them the defaults are enough. If you are interested in further configuration,
take a look at <configurationfile>. For the beginning you just have to set the
directory for your dotfiles and for your profiles. To do so, either create a new
file called `dotmanager.ini` or copy the example from `docs/config-example.ini`.

You can store the configuration file at one of the following places:
    - dotmanager/data/dotmanager.ini
    - ~/.config/dotmanager/dotmanager.ini
    - /etc/dotmanager/dotmanager.ini

Then set the values `targetFiles` and `profileFiles` in the "Settings" section:

.. code:: ini

    [Settings]
    profileFiles = /path/to/your/profiles/
    targetFiles  = /path/to/your/dotfiles/


-----------------------
Step 3: A first profile
-----------------------
For a simple test we will create a first profile. So go ahead and create a file
in your profile directory. It doesn't matter what you name it, as long it ends
on ".py".
You can copy the following, but replace `<filename>` with a file that exists in
your dotfile directory:

.. code:: python

    from dotmanager.profile import profile

    class Test1(Profile):
        def generate():
            link("<filename>")

Now installing this profile is easy:

.. code:: bash

    ./dotmgr.py -i Test1
    # or
    ./dotmgr.py --install Test1
