Welcome to Dotmanager's documentation!
======================================

Dotmanager is a tool to manage different versions of your dotfiles on different
hosts. Dotmanager is intended to give you maximal flexibility while checking
the integrity of all operations that you configured/programmed to prevent that you
accidentally break your systems. To achieve this you can write simple profiles
which will define a set of dotfiles that you want to install.

This documetation covers installation instructions, user guides, configuration examples
and guides for developers as well as a reference manual.

For installation instructions please take a look at :doc:`usage/getting-started`.
